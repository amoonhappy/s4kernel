This is a personal usage repository for Galaxy S4 Kernel customization by Amoonhappy.

Implemented enhancements:
1. 64G exFAT sdcard support
2. USB charger speed increase from 600mA to 800mA
3. Disable some debug
4. Disable zRAM and SWAP for better battery life
5. add kernel built-in CPU governor (interactive, conservative etc)
6. add Simple I/O (sio) Scheduler
7. enable CIFS/NFS filesystem
8. New Arizona (WM5102) platform drivers. (Thanks to AndreiLux)
9. Minor tuning on the big.LITTLE switch param, the CPU will switch to A7 cores a bit faster than stock kernel
10.enable ARM CPU topology (SCHED_MC default 0)
11.enable dynamic CPU hotplug
12.enable arizona haptics
13.enable USB OTG
14.Wifi drivers modified to allow only unicast and mDNS traffic through, this should fix battery draining on dirty networks. (Thanks to AndreiLux)

Todo:
1. battery drain testing for 10-11
2. init.d support
3. unfinished OC for A15 cores
4. CPU undervolting 
5. bus, mem, LCD, undervolting stablization testing
6. PowerVR SGX544MP3 OC & UV
